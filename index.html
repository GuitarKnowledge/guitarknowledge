	<P><h3>The guitar is one of the world’s most popular instruments. Its timeless appeal comes from its versatility and its romantic appeal, as well as its amplified power in modern music. Light enough to be easily portable, it can be played as a solo instrument or as part of a band or music ensemble. A guitar’s musical tone compliments a singing voice and it has a wide note range so it makes a perfect support instrument for singers. It is entertaining to play and many find a lot of satisfaction in learning this skill.
		<br><br>
		The guitar originally had four courses of strings, three double, the top course single, that ran from a violin-like pegbox to a tension bridge glued to the soundboard, or belly; the bridge thus sustained the direct pull of the strings. In the belly was a circular sound hole, often ornamented with a carved wooden rose. The 16th-century guitar was tuned C–F–A–D′, the tuning of the centre four courses of the lute and of the vihuela.<br><br>

From the 16th to the 19th century several changes occurred in the instrument. A fifth course of strings was added before 1600; by the late 18th century a sixth course was added. Before 1800 the double courses were replaced by single strings tuned E–A–D–G–B–E′, still the standard tuning.</h3></P>

<u><h2>The Natural Musical Alphabet<h2></u>
<p><h3> When learning how to play guitar, you should know the musical alphabet is a little different than the alphabet you learned as a child. Learning notes starts with some basic music theory. With the natural musical alphabet, you only have seven notes – A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. They’re called natural since you have no flats or sharps. All your sharps and flats occur between these notes. Once you know these, learning sharps and flats is as simple as moving up or down.</h3></p>
<br>

<u><h2>Sharps and Flats<h2></u>
<p><h3>Sharps and flats are just half-steps away from the natural notes. So what’s the big difference between the two? It’s all in how you move. Every half-step (or fret) changes the note. Sharps are a half-step up from a natural note. For instance, a half-step above A is A#.Flats are the exact opposite. One half-step down leads to a flat. For instance, if you step down from A, you’d get Ab. The confusing part comes into play with a single note has two names and the name depends mainly on the key you’re playing in. For instance, the note between D and E is D# if you’re stepping up and Eb if you’re stepping down.</h3></p>
<br><br>

<u><h2>The BC And RF Rule<h2></u>
<p><h3>All natural notes have sharps and flats between them except BC and EF. A half-step between these leads to the next natural note. Stepping up from B leads you to C. Stepping down from F leads to E.</h3></p>
<br>

<u><h2>CORDS</h2></u>
<p><h3>The musical theory of chords is reviewed, to provide terminology for a discussion of guitar chords. Three kinds of chords, which are emphasized in introductions to guitar-playing are discussed. These basic chords arise in chord-triples that are conventional in Western music, triples that are called three-chord progressions. After each type of chord is introduced, its role in three-chord progressions is noted.

Intermediate discussions of chords derive both chords and their progressions simultaneously from the harmonization of scales. The basic guitar-chords can be constructed by "stacking thirds", that is, by concatenating two or three third-intervals, where all of the lowest notes come from the scale.</h3></p>
<br><br>

<u><h2>Triplets:</h2></u>

<h3>Both major and minor chords are examples of musical triads, which contain three distinct notes. Triads are often introduced as an ordered triplet:</h3>

<ul>
	<li><h3>The Root note</h3></li>
	<li><h3>The third note, which is above the root by either a major third (for a major chord) or a minor third (for a minor chord)</h3></li>
	<li><h3>The fifth note, which is a perfect fifth above the root; consequently, the fifth is a third above the third—either a minor third above a major third or a major third above a minor third. The major triad has a root, a major third, and a fifth. (The major chord's major-third interval is replaced by a minor-third interval in the minor chord.</h3></li>
</ul>
